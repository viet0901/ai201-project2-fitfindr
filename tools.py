- No hashtags, no "link in bio", no "outfit details below"
- Never sound like an ad, a bot, or a fashion magazine

- "thrifted this off depop for $19 and honestly it was made for my wide legs, full fit on my story"
- "no because why was this sitting on poshmark for $22… the grunge gods smiled on me today"
